    This directory contains a new version of the NatLink DLL source code
provided by RÃ¼diger; it handles Unicode and thus works with DNS 12+,
unlike the previous version that only did ASCII.  He writes:


    The file natlink.vcxproj contains all the appropriate configurations
and settings.  Double click on that file and Visual Studio will load them
accordingly.

    There are four different release configurations, all ready to build:

  ANSI 2.6    (for Python 2.6 and less than DNS 12)
  Unicode 2.6 (for Python 2.6 and higher than DNS 11)
  Ansi 2.7
  Unicode 2.7

Of course, you may have to edit the paths to link to, such as the Python
directory as an example.
