  <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"><title>My RSI Story</title></head><body>
<p>In March 1998 I worked an entire weekend to meet a major deadline with important 
  revenue consequences for my employer. By Sunday night my wrists and hands were 
  tingling and sensitive, and the next day I had significant wrist pain. In previous 
  years I had had minor symptoms, but they had always gone away.<br>
  <br>
  I knew to treat my injury seriously since I have friends with debilitating RSI 
  problems. But, I was starting at square zero in terms of knowledge and treatment, 
  and still in the middle of a high-pressure work situation. As I began to realize 
  my injury was serious I started searching for solutions. Everyone I talked to 
  had different ideas, and every idea seemed to involve 30-90 minutes a day of 
  work on my part. I could handle the regimen of one or two of these, but in the 
  absence of real progress it was hard to have confidence. In the subsequent months 
  I tried doctors, occupational therapy, anti-inflammatories, massage, a new chair, 
  acupuncture, rolfing, special keyboards, physical therapy, drinking lots of 
  water, chiropractic, vitamins, myotherapy, and glucosamine sulfate. Nothing 
  seemed to make a reliable difference.<br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile my company was supportive and willing to provide what I asked. But 
  while it was easy to ask for new equipment and small schedule accommodations, 
  I couldn't bring myself to ask for major time commitments from other people 
  or major project slippage. I adjusted all my habits to require as little typing 
  is possible, but continued to type when necessary (occasionally a considerable 
  amount).<br>
  <br>
  Unfortunately it took a year of this before I began using voice recognition 
  and started truly resting my hands. I can't know for sure, but I believe that 
  had I started using voice recognition right away I would have recovered. During 
  several periods I've made significant recovery, but despite vigilance in most 
  every activity I have always slipped up. Once it was snow shoveling, once un-careful 
  fiddling, and once not-wimpy-enough weightlifting in a strengthening program. 
  Of all the things I have tried, the only ones that have reliably helped are 
  avoiding irritating activities and voice recognition. Of some help have been 
  stretching, posture improvement, myotherapy, and massage. </p>
<p> Since resting my hands seemed so important I tried for hands-free computer 
  use as much as possible. The Dragon Macro Language made this possible but was 
  excruciatingly cumbersome, so I was very excited when Joel Gould released NatLink. 
  Shortly thereafter (at NEFFA) Patricia Hawkins and I were comparing notes about 
  NatLink. Her comment "yeah, but you still have to change two places" got me 
  thinking about Vocola. <br>
  <br>
  Designing, implementing, and using Vocola has been a rewarding bright spot among 
  otherwise unsuccessful attempts at recovery. And thankfully, with Dragon NaturallySpeaking, 
  NatLink, and Vocola I've continued to be effective at my job.<br>
  <br>
  The main lesson I take away is to stand up for my own needs when they conflict 
  with the needs and desires of others. That Monday deadline seemed very important 
  at the time, but everybody would have survived just fine if I had delivered 
  a week later. The customer was adamant about the deadline, but as it happens 
  they ultimately canceled the project! And even after my initial injury, if I 
  had been brave enough during the first year to ask for difficult adjustments 
  at work I might have been able to recover quickly.</p>
<p>One doctor I saw said "With constant vigilance you can get a little better 
  every year" and at this writing (December 2004) things are looking up somewhat, 
  I'm starting to type a little and play some careful fiddle.<br>
