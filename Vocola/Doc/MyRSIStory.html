In March 1998 I worked an entire weekend to meet a major deadline with important
revenue consequences for my employer. By Sunday night my wrists and hands
were tingling and sensitive, and the next day I had significant wrist pain.
In previous years I had had minor symptoms, but they had always gone away.<br>
<br>
I knew to treat my injury seriously since I have friends with debilitating
RSI problems. But, I was starting at square zero in terms of knowledge and
treatment, and still in the middle of a high-pressure work situation. As
I began to realize my injury was serious I started searching for solutions.
Everyone I talked to had different ideas, and every idea seemed to involve
30-90 minutes a day of work on my part. I could handle the regimen of one
or two of these, but in the absence of real progress it was hard to have
confidence. In the subsequent months I tried doctors, occupational therapy,
anti-inflammatories, massage, a new chair, acupuncture, rolfing, special
keyboards, physical therapy, drinking lots of water, chiropractic, vitamins,
myotherapy, and glucosamine sulfate. Nothing seemed to make a reliable difference.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile my company was supportive and willing to provide what I asked.
But while it was easy to ask for new equipment and small schedule accommodations,
I couldn't bring myself to ask for major time commitments from other people
or major project slippage. I adjusted all my habits to require as little
typing is possible, but continued to type when necessary (occasionally a
considerable amount).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately it took a year of this before I began using voice recognition and 
started truly resting my hands. I can't know for sure, but I believe that had 
I started using voice recognition right away I would have recovered. I may yet 
recover, but at this writing (May 2003) I still cannot do any significant typing 
or play much violin. My diagnosis is tendinitis, and my prescription is "With 
constant vigilance you can get a little better every year." During several periods 
I've made significant recovery, but despite vigilance in most every activity I 
have always slipped up. Once it was snow shoveling, once un-careful fiddling, 
and once not-wimpy-enough weightlifting in a strengthening program. Of all the 
things I have tried, the only ones that have reliably helped are avoiding irritating 
activities, myotherapy, putty exercises, massage, and voice recognition.<br>
<br>
Since resting my hands seemed so important I tried for hands-free computer
use as much as possible. The Dragon Macro Language made this possible but
was excruciatingly cumbersome, so I was very excited when Joel Gould released
NatLink. Shortly thereafter (at NEFFA) Patricia Hawkins and I were comparing
notes about NatLink. Her comment "yeah, but you still have to change two
places" got me thinking about Vocola. <br>
<br>
Designing, implementing, and using Vocola has been a rewarding bright spot
among otherwise unsuccessful attempts at recovery. And thankfully, with Dragon
NaturallySpeaking, NatLink, and Vocola I've continued to be effective at
my job.<br>
<br>
The main lesson I take away is to stand up for my own needs when they conflict
with the needs and desires of others. That Monday deadline seemed very important
at the time, but everybody would have survived just fine if I had delivered
a week later. The customer was adamant about the deadline, but as it happens
they ultimately canceled the project! And even after my initial injury, if
I had been brave enough during the first year to ask for difficult adjustments
at work I might have been able to recover.<br>
