This GUI is now about ready for use.

With this GUI you can configure configure natlink.  It is written in wxPython.  

The definitions are made with the (nonfree) wxDesigner program.  The definition file for wxDesigner is called configurenatlink.wdr.

But the definitions that are read by wxPython are in: configurenatlink_wdr.py

The program itself is in: configurenatlink.py

It uses functions from the module: natlinkconfigfunctions.py.

If the GUI program doesn't work for some reason, you can fall back to the command line interface, which is contained in natlinkconfigfunctions.py.  Just started this program from the start menu or the full that you are in now.
