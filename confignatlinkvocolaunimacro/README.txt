The GUI is NOT READY.


But with natlinkconfigfunctions.py you can do all the functionality:

Run this module with python (goto explorer, right click on this file, Open (or Open with, python).

Type i for information, u for usage.

In order to try prudent, first 
-enable natlink (e)
-disable vocola (V) (clearing the VocolaUserDirectory)
-disable unimacro (N) (clearing the natlink userDirectory)

-Quit the configure program and RESTART Dragon NaturallySpeaking.


After that try to:
-switch on vocola by "v path/to/vocola/user/files"

-switch on unimacro (if downloaded separate!) with "n path/to/unimacro/grammar/files"

And additionally try to switch on additional vocola things. See u (usage) for all the commands
